Building on top of Squads on Solana

Resource - https://hyperdrive.squads.so

how this platform should work is that there is a governance token

And people can make certain proposals(which would then be added as a proposal to a Squad Multisig and signed by a PDA)

And then with that token , people can vote if they agree or not to a certain proposal
